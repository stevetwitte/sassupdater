# sassupdater

This is a program written as a gui interface to the sass gem. I wrote it to solve a specific problem with a project that I work on.
The project has a couple very big sass files and using sass --watch with them is very slow to update.

So this little tool lets you add sass files to a list and then update them or force update them whenever you want.

It's not much and there is probably something that already does it but I wanted a super simple program and this is it.
